# Bike_sharing_demand_project
This project focuses on predicting bike sharing demand using the AutoGluon Framework and by performing feature engineering to the data. Bike sharing comprises of systems of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated through a network of locations throughout a city. By using this system people are able to rent a bike from a location and return it to a different location. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing progams around the world.

Reseachers are attracted by the level of data generated by these systems because the duration of travel, departure and arrival locations, and time elapsed is explicitly recorded. The dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand
